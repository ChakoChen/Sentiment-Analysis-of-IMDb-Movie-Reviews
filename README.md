## Sentiment-Analysis-of-IMDb-Movie-Reviews

This project uses a dataset of 50,000 movie reviews taken from IMDb to build a sentiment classification model. 

The data was compiled by Andrew Maas and can be found here: IMDb Reviews (http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/). The data is split evenly with 25k reviews intended for training and 25k for testing your classifier. Moreover, each set has 12.5k positive and 12.5k negative reviews. IMDb lets users rate movies on a scale from 1 to 10. To label these reviews the curator of the data labeled anything with ≤ 4 stars as negative and anything with ≥ 7 stars as positive. Reviews with 5 or 6 stars were left out.
